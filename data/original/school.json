ORGs will typically have a parent ORG (up to the national level), and children, allowing a hierarchy to be established. School is defined here as the place where the learning happens. Most commonly this is the data that describes a bricks and mortar building, or, in the case of a virtual school, the virtual school organization. For enrollment and result reporting purposes, little information about this organization is required. A common example of a local organization is a school district.",
